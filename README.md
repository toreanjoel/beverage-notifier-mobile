# beverage-notifier-mobile
The mobile client that will interact with BLE server listening and notifying where required.

# Build
This is built with React Native. The IOS build is not part of the scope for this development and this will only work on Android devices.

# Note:
This needs cleaning up. There are a few things that should not be there and the system has code that can be refactored but for the scope, that is not something that we worry about getting working for an MVP.

This is why there is no install instructions as this is not meant to be shared in the current state but the system should still work if installed using RN for Android.
